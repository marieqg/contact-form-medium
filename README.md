This is a tutorial to help you create a contact form with MailGun, Gatsby.js and Netlify. You can read the all article related to this repository [here](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/jamstack-how-to-do-a-contact-form-step-by-step-with-gatsby-js-netlify-and-mailgun-52d26432a5c4).


## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Add your own development variables.**


 -  Rename the file  ``` example.env.development``` to ```env.development```
 - Add your own Instagram Token between the ```" "```


2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
    
    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
